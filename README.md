This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust related to mutable and immutable borrows. The `bug.rs` file contains code that exhibits unexpected behavior due to the simultaneous existence of mutable and immutable references to the same variable. The `bugSolution.rs` provides a solution that addresses this issue.  Understanding how Rust's borrow checker works is crucial to avoid this type of error.
